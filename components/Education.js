              I completed two years of the three-year Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science at the University
              of Bologna, gaining a strong foundation in programming, computer security, and collaboration skills through
              group projects.<br />
              <br />
              Although I completed only two years of studies, my experience at the University of Bologna was a
              significant personal and professional growth opportunity.
