              I attended the three-year Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science at the
              University of Bologna for two years, one of the oldest universities in the world.
              During this period, I gained a solid foundation in computer science, learning the
              basic principles of programming and computer security.
              <br />
              <br />
              I had the opportunity to collaborate with my classmates and participate in some group
              projects, developing my communication and teamwork skills.
              <br />
              <br />
              Although I completed only two years of studies, the experience at the University of
              Bologna represented an important phase of personal and professional growth for me.
