          I completed two years of the three-year Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science at
          the University of Bologna, gaining a strong foundation in programming, computer security,
          and collaboration skills through group projects.<br /><br />
          Although I completed only two years of studies, my experience at the University of Bologna
          was a significant personal and professional growth opportunity.
